# PHQ-9 Calculator

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 calculator, developed by our team, computes your standardized depression score, compared with the Brazilian population.The standardized score (T Score) is a measure that uses a method called Item Response Theory, based on the analyses of answers to the same questions by Brazilians in the National Health Survey of 2019 (Damiano et al. 2023 - https://doi.org/10.47626/1516-4446-2022-2945). This standardized score ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 to 50 representing no symptoms, 50 to 60 representing a few symptoms, between 60 and 70 as moderate symptoms, and above 70 as severe symptoms that warrant clinical attention for depression.
